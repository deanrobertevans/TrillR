## Overview
The ``TrillR`` package was originally developed as a few functions to assist in the random selection of wildlife accoustic recordings for species identification. This package has grown and is now part of a workflow for the selection of these recordings with the exclusion of bad weather days.

This package is largly dependent on using SoX - Sound eXchange which can be downloaded here: <https://sourceforge.net/projects/sox/files/sox/>. 

## Installation
The development version of the TrillR package can be downloaded in R.
```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("deanrobertevans/TrillR")
```
## Usage

```
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
